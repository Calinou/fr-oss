# fr-oss keyboard layout

A keyboard layout that enhances AZERTY with accented uppercase and additional
special characters.

Taken from <http://mjulier.free.fr/clavier/>. No source code is provided

## Variants

- **fr-oss (`setup.exe`):** Types accented uppercase letters instead of numbers when
  Caps Lock is enabled. This is the recommended option if you want
  to write correct French words in uppercase :slightly_smiling_face:
- **fr-ossc (`setup_ossc.exe`):** Types numbers instead of accented uppercase letters when
  Caps Lock is enabled. This may be a better option on laptops if you
  frequently type numbers.
